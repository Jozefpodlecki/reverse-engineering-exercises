# Why Does x64dbg Stop in ntdll.dll First?

When debugging a program using x64dbg, it often stops in `ntdll.dll` first due to how Windows handles process initialization and the critical role of `ntdll.dll` in the process.

## Key Reasons Why x64dbg Stops in `ntdll.dll` First

### 1. Process Initialization
- When a process starts, Windows loads essential DLLs into its address space. `ntdll.dll` is one of the first DLLs loaded because it contains low-level functions required for process initialization, memory management, and system calls.
- The program's entry point (e.g., `main` or `WinMain`) hasn't been reached yet. The debugger stops at the earliest point in the process's execution, which is often inside `ntdll.dll`.

### 2. System Calls and API Dispatching
- `ntdll.dll` is responsible for handling system calls (syscalls) and interfacing with the Windows kernel. Many Windows API functions eventually call into `ntdll.dll` to perform their operations.
- During startup, the program may call functions like `LdrInitializeThunk` or `RtlUserThreadStart` in `ntdll.dll` to set up the process environment.

### 3. Debugger Initialization
- The debugger (x64dbg) attaches to the process very early in its lifecycle, often before the program's main code begins executing. This means the debugger catches the process while it is still initializing, which involves `ntdll.dll`.

### 4. Breakpoint on Entry
- By default, x64dbg sets a breakpoint on the process entry point. However, before reaching the program's entry point, the process must go through initialization code in `ntdll.dll`. This is why the debugger stops there first.

### 5. Thread Creation
- When a process starts, the primary thread is created, and its execution begins in `ntdll.dll` to set up the thread's environment before jumping to the program's entry point.

## What to Do Next
- To reach the program's entry point, continue execution (press `F9` or click "Run") until the program's main code is reached.
- Alternatively, set a breakpoint on the program's entry point (e.g., `main` or `WinMain`) and run the program until it hits that breakpoint.

## Summary
x64dbg stops in `ntdll.dll` first because it is a fundamental part of the Windows process initialization process. The debugger catches the process early in its lifecycle, before the program's main code begins executing. This behavior is normal and expected when debugging Windows applications.
