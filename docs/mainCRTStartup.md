# Analysis of `mainCRTStartup`

## Overview
`mainCRTStartup` is the entry point for Windows applications, responsible for setting up the runtime environment before executing the `main` function.

## Function Breakdown
1. **Stack Setup** - Allocates 40 bytes on the stack for local variables and function calls.
2. **Security Initialization** - Calls `__security_init_cookie()` to set up a security cookie, preventing stack buffer overflow attacks.
3. **Stack Cleanup** - Restores the stack pointer after security setup.
4. **Runtime Execution** - Jumps to `__scrt_common_main_seh()`, which initializes the C++ runtime, sets up structured exception handling (SEH), and calls `main()`.

## Purpose
This function ensures the program starts with proper security measures, exception handling, and runtime initialization before executing the actual application logic.
