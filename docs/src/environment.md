# Environment Details

The exact output of compiled binaries will vary slightly depending on your compiler version, target architecture, and operating system. To make results reproducible, here are the specifics of the environment Iâ€™ll be using throughout this book:

```sh
rustc --version --verbose

> The host field (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) indicates the target platform: 64-bit Intel/AMD (x86_64), Windows OS (windows), and MSVC toolchain (msvc). This affects calling conventions, linking, and debug info (like PDB files)
